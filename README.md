# DNS Zone Explorer

Queries and reconstructs a DNS zone tree, presenting the information
graphically, making it easy to grasp the extent of the zone and spot any
anomalies or vulnerabilities.

## To do

- Update DNS zone graph colour palette with a fresher and more appealing one,
  with no transparency in node colours
- Clean up Livebook code
- Fully document code, write up decisions taken, with their reasons
- Fully document the project in this README file

# Roadmap, or exploration of future functionality

## Roadmap

* [ ] Incorporate all DKIM selectors found on the internet to improve the general use of the audit tool
* [ ] Refactor all code; rebuild into a full `mix` project, carefully documenting all expected interactions, along with lots of doc-, unit, property and type specification testing
* [ ] Build a DKIM key checker and verifier
* [ ] Build DKIM key and record generator
* [ ] Build SPF record generator
* [ ] Build DMARC record generator

## Interesting future functionality

In addition to checking SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for a domain, there are several other useful and practical functionalities that you could include in your domain auditing system. These additional features would enhance security, performance, and overall health checks for the domain. Here’s a comprehensive list of features you might want to consider:

1. SSL/TLS Certificate Validation

* Check SSL/TLS Certificate: Verify that the domain has a valid SSL certificate installed, check its expiration date, and ensure that the certificate chain is complete.
* SSL Configuration: Audit the strength of the SSL configuration (e.g., supported protocols and ciphers). Tools like SSL Labs can give a rating, and you could include this as part of your audit.
* Certificate Transparency Logs: Verify that the domain’s certificates appear in Certificate Transparency logs to detect any fraudulent certificates.

1. DNS Record Health Check

* A, AAAA Records: Ensure that the domain resolves correctly to an IP address and provides both IPv4 (A) and IPv6 (AAAA) records if applicable.
* MX Records: Check that valid mail exchange (MX) records are set up for email delivery.
* CNAME Records: Ensure the proper use of CNAME records and check for any misconfigurations.
* NS Records: Verify that the correct name servers (NS) are associated with the domain.

1. DNSSEC Validation

* DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions): Check if DNSSEC is enabled, ensuring the integrity of DNS responses by verifying that they are digitally signed.

1. WHOIS Information & Expiration

* WHOIS Lookup: Display registration information for the domain, including ownership details, registration and expiration dates.
* Domain Expiration: Alert if the domain is nearing expiration to avoid potential service disruptions.

1. Email Security Checks

* Open Relay Test: Ensure the mail server is not an open relay, preventing unauthorized users from sending emails through the domain.
* Blacklist Check: Verify if the domain or associated IPs are on email blacklists (e.g., Spamhaus, Barracuda). This can impact email deliverability.

1. Subdomain & Wildcard Record Check

* Subdomain Enumeration: Audit subdomains to ensure none are vulnerable, misconfigured, or publicly exposed without proper security.
* Wildcard Records: Check for any wildcard DNS records (*) that could unintentionally expose your domain.

1. Web Application Security

* HTTP Headers Audit: Check for common security headers like X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, etc.
* Redirect Validation: Ensure that HTTP to HTTPS redirection is properly set up.
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection: Verify whether headers and settings that prevent XSS attacks are present.

1. Brute Force & Rate-Limiting Protections

* Rate-Limiting: Check if the web server or application has rate-limiting mechanisms in place to protect against brute force attacks or resource exhaustion.

1. Uptime Monitoring

* Service Availability: Check the domain’s uptime and response times, monitoring performance over time. Tools like Pingdom or UptimeRobot can be integrated for alerts.

1. Content Verification

* Website Defacement Detection: Check for changes in website content that could indicate defacement or security breaches.
* Malware Scanning: Scan the domain for known malware signatures or indications of a compromised site.

1. Redirection Check

* Check for Improper Redirects: Ensure the domain doesn’t redirect to malicious or unintended locations.

1. Reverse DNS (PTR Records)

* PTR Record Validation: Check if reverse DNS (rDNS) entries are set up correctly, which can be useful for email server validation and anti-spam measures.

1. CDN & Performance Auditing

* Content Delivery Network (CDN) Check: Detect whether the domain is using a CDN and verify that it’s configured properly for performance and security (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront).
* Page Load Speed: Analyze the performance of the website, including time-to-first-byte, page load speed, and whether caching is effectively used.

1. Geolocation of Servers

* Server Location Verification: Check where the servers hosting the domain are located geographically. This can be useful for regulatory compliance and understanding latency issues.

1. Redundant NS and MX Configuration

* NS and MX Redundancy Check: Ensure that name servers and mail servers have redundancy to avoid single points of failure.

1. Broken Link Detection

* Broken Links Check: Audit the domain for broken internal and external links that could impact user experience or SEO.

1. SEO & Indexing Checks

* Robots.txt: Check the robots.txt file to ensure it’s not inadvertently blocking important content from being indexed by search engines.
* Sitemap Check: Validate if the domain has an XML sitemap that helps search engines crawl the website efficiently.
* Canonical Tags: Ensure proper use of canonical tags to avoid duplicate content issues.

1. Security Vulnerability Scanning

* Basic Vulnerability Scans: Run basic scans for common web vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.) using tools like OWASP ZAP or Nikto.

1. Brand & Domain Protection

* Typosquatting Check: Identify any domains registered that are similar to yours (typosquatting), which could be used in phishing attacks.
* Domain Backorder Monitoring: Monitor important or similar domains that are expiring or available for backordering to prevent third-party ownership.

1. Historical DNS & Record Tracking

* Historical DNS Changes: Track past changes in DNS records (useful for identifying breaches or misconfigurations over time).

1. Customizable Reporting & Alerts

* Automated Reports: Create detailed reports on the health and security status of the domain.
* Real-time Alerts: Offer real-time notifications for critical issues like certificate expiration, blacklisting, or DNS changes.

1. Third-Party Service Integrations

* Integration with External APIs: Integrate with external services (like Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal, etc.) for malware scanning and threat detection.
* API Access: Provide an API for users to automate domain checks.

These features would offer a comprehensive audit of a domain, covering its security, performance, email configuration, and overall health.

## Further considerations
